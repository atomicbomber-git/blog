Take this kiss upon a brow  
And in parting from you now  
Thus much let me avow  
You are not wrong who deem--  
That my days have been a dream  
And yet if hope has flown away  
In a night or in a day  
In a vision or in none  
Is it therefore less gone?  


Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
