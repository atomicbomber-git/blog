Hello. I am __Anton__, but I usually call myself __James__ or __atomicbomber__ on
the Internet. Recently, people suggested me to create a blog and write about the things that I know there. I find the idea interesting. I have been reading about writing and the benefits it may bring to those who do it regularly, and I've been wanting to try it myself to see if it's really true. So here's my first blog post. I finally decided to do it.

Well, since I usually work with computers, my posts will also be generally about them. A lot of them will be about software development and how I manage my systems. Apart from these kind of stuff, I will also write things about other issues such as books, life, society, and anything else that interests me at the moment.

So here it is, it's my first blog post. Other posts will be written in the future when I have the time to do so.
